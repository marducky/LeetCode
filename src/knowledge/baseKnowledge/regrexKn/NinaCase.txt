Overall notes
Hyperlinks
Hyperlinks are currently implemented differently on each platform. In later releases we should make the mobile implementation match the web implementation. Here are screenshots of the current hyperlink implementations.
On web, they look like this:


On Mobile, they look like this:





Requirements (From Abhinav)
Agent transfers:

The end goal is that an end user can escalate to live chat anytime after saying “I’d like to speak with a live agent”. However, we also want to show the following two scenarios:
The option of escalating to live chat is NOT provided for some of the use cases – could you mark one of the use error paths for each vertical for this. Matt will have to build this logic in kQuery.
The option of escalating to live chat is provided proactively as part of Nina’s response in case Nina cannot handle the use case – could you update one of the error paths for each vertical with this proactive response.

General Comments:

The below use cases are prioritized
We should combine certain use cases, wherever possible
The demo needs to be relevant for NA, EMEA and APAC. Differences like $ and £/€ need to be handled.
For Telco, EMEA has a request to integrate with WorldManuals for the ‘device troubleshooting’ use case
The demo should be across Web and Mobile (demo it on Web as well as Mobile)
The mobile demo should show the experience that fits Nina Mobile MC
