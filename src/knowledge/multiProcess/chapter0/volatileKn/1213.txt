I think there are two import about courages, the courage that when you faced and overcome something filled with despair, and the courage the when you do something that can bring you hope or when you done it your heart fill with happiness. Some years ago, I think the courage may be the first one. But actually, I have gone through both before this. But now I may choose the second one to make my courage pure. You don't know how hard when I solve somethings in much terrible trouble. what's more, to my surprise it should be something that I can remember from my origin family, my both hometown, where the one who did things seriously wrong can be supported by others, where many people persist in the old principle and don't change these, and the first thing that these parents can take in heart may be how honor it can bring them when they decide whether to send their children to school. And the children who entered to the high level school still have these actions, which is absolutely incredible. I hate the culture ditied or polluted by the old tradition. But now I am going to make myself not influenced by these things.
So come on. The Lucky boy.
